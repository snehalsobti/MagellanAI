# MagellanAI
An intelligent course planning Assistant for undergraduate computer and electrical engineering students at the University of Toronto: a platform that helps students explore courses, receive personalized guidance, and build course profiles that align with their interests and meet graduation requirements.

## Introduction
Course planning in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) program at the University of Toronto (UofT) has become increasingly complex due to numerous program requirements, prerequisites, breadth and depth constraints, and elective options. Magellan is a tool used by UofT ECE students to select courses and validate the requirements. While Magellan provides an essential platform for verifying degree requirements, it cannot guide students in aligning their course selections with personal interests, career goals, or minors and certificates. Students often spend considerable time iterating through trial profiles, manually checking prerequisites, and balancing competing constraints, which can result in frustration and suboptimal academic plans. To address this challenge, our project, MagellanAI, leverages AI-driven conversational interfaces and constraint satisfaction methods to automatically generate complete, valid, and personalized Magellan profiles. By integrating student goals directly into the profile generation process, MagellanAI aims to streamline course planning, save time, and improve academic decision-making for upper-year ECE students.
